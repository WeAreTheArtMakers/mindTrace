# Contributing to MindTrace

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Principles

1. **Keep it simple** - Resist feature creep. Every addition should serve the core purpose.
2. **Mobile-first** - Test on small screens. If it doesn't work on iPhone XS, it doesn't ship.
3. **No tracking** - No analytics, no user accounts, no cookies.
4. **Human-focused** - This is about human thinking, not AI-generated content.

## What We Won't Accept

- User accounts or authentication
- Likes, comments, or social features
- AI-generated thinking or suggestions
- Heavy animations or complex UI
- Analytics or tracking code

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
